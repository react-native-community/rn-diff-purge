# Using rn-diff-purge

The git patches can be used as a replacement of `react-native-git-upgrade`. The procedure is
straightforward and more trusted than using the upgrade command.

## Recommended method

#### 1 Check the diff
Check the diff of your current version and the version you want to upgrade to.

#### 2 Manually do the changes
Do the changes from the diff in your project.
They are usually no more than 10 lines, so it's pretty quick and easy.
If it's more than that, you could try the alternative method below.
:warning: In any case, make sure you pay attention to the changes made. It's always imporant to know what an upgrade actually changed.

## Alternative method (using patch)

#### 1 Download the git patch

Download the patch for your version, for example:

```shell
curl https://github.com/react-native-community/rn-diff-purge/compare/version/0.29.0...version/0.30.0.diff > upgrade-rn.patch
```

#### 2 Prepare the patch

The patch is made for the RnDiffApp located in the *RnDiffApp* folder of this repository.
To use it in your own repository, some changes are needed.

Don't worry about the root folder *RnDiffApp*, it can be ignored with the option `-p 2`
(see https://git-scm.com/docs/git-apply)

Then, some files include the name of the app in their path:

- All files in the `ios` directory (example: `ios/RnDiffApp/AppDelegate.m`)
- Some files in the `android` directory (example:
`android/app/src/main/java/com/rndiffapp/MainActivity.java`)

You have to edit the patch and replace all occurences of `ios/RnDiffApp` and `com/rndiffapp`
by the name of your app.

#### 3 Set up the 3-way merge

By default in case of conflicts, the `git apply` command will fail and leave the files untouched.
It could be interesting to fallback on a 3-way merge (option `--3way`) in order to resolve the
conflicts with your favorite merge tool.

To do this, git needs to know the blob referenced in the patch
(line `index 4c88077..e49e881 100644` for example). So you have to add rn-diff as a remote
repository and fetch it (see this [SO question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33577383/git-apply-3way-error-repository-lacks-the-necessary-blob-to-fall-back-on-3-way)
for details).

```shell
git remote add rn-diff-purge https://github.com/react-native-community/rn-diff-purge.git
git fetch rn-diff-purge
```

#### 4 Run the apply command
```shell
git apply upgrade-rn.patch --exclude=package.json -p 2 --3way
```


### Wrap up

```shell
# Download the patch
curl https://github.com/react-native-community/rn-diff-purge/compare/version/0.29.0...version/0.30.0.diff > upgrade-rn.patch

# Replace RnDiffApp occurences
appNameCamelCase=MyApp
appNameLowerCase=myapp
sed -i "" "s-ios/RnDiffApp-ios/${appNameCamelCase}-" upgrade-rn.patch
sed -i "" "s-java/com/rndiffapp-java/com/${appNameLowerCase}-" upgrade-rn.patch

# Set up the 3-way merge
git remote add rn-diff-purge https://github.com/react-native-community/rn-diff-purge.git
git fetch rn-diff-purge

# Run the apply command
git apply upgrade-rn.patch --exclude=package.json -p 2 --3way
```

### :warning: Known issues
Sometimes there are new files that reference the project's name. Whenever there is a new file, make sure to check for this, and replace it with your project's name.
