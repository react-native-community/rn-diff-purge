+This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).
+
+# Getting Started
+
+>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.
+
+## Step 1: Start the Metro Server
+
+First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.
+
+To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:
+
+```bash
+# using npm
+npm start
+
+# OR using Yarn
+yarn start
+```
+
+## Step 2: Start your Application
+
+Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:
+
+### For Android
+
+```bash
+# using npm
+npm run android
+
+# OR using Yarn
+yarn android
+```
+
+### For iOS
+
+```bash
+# using npm
+npm run ios
+
+# OR using Yarn
+yarn ios
+```
+
+If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.
+
+This is one way to run your app — you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.
+
+## Step 3: Modifying your App
+
+Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.
+
+1. Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
+2. For **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on Window and Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on macOS)) to see your changes!
+
+   For **iOS**: Hit <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!
+
+## Congratulations! :tada:
+
+You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
+
+### Now what?
